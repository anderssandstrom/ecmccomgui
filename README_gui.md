# PYQT GUI

All data is accessiblie in the iocsh but sometimes it's simpler with a graphical GUI. The graphical GUI is generic and can be used to control motors and to read/write data. 

## Prepare shell and start GUI
1. Start a new terminal/shell by pressing the blach button ">_" in upper left corner of screen 
2. Activate conda environment in order to use the correct python module versions

```
source activate ecmccomgui_py35
```
![Activate conda](doc/gui/condaenv_small.png)

3. Go to GUI repo:
```
cd
cd source/ecmccomgui
```

4. Start GUI:

```
python ecmcGuiMain.py
```
![Start GUI](doc/gui/startGUI_small.png)

5. Choose process variable:

Some examples are listed in the dropdown lists. However, any PV name can be entered.

The available PV names you can reach can be listed with the "dbl" command in the iocsh of the running ioc.

Example of motor PV = IOC_TEST:Axis1

ioc prefix: "IOC_TEST:"

pv name: "Axis1"

Example ethercat PV = IOC_TEST:ec0-s3-EL5002-CH1-PosAct

ioc prefix: "IOC_TEST:"

pv name: "ec0-s3-EL5002-CH1-PosAct"

6. Start GUI for stepper axis:

press the "open gui" button

Depending on the PV type different GUI windows will appear.

If the type of the pv is "motor" then the following GUI for the EPICS motor record should appear:

![Motor GUI](doc/pics/ecmcMotorGui_small.png)

If the type of the pv is a normal scalar then the following GUI should appear:

![Generic GUI](doc/pics/ecmcPvTrend_small.png)


## Motor GUI window

The GUI is devided into two panels:

* The left panel is for control and EPICS motor record specific status and control.

* The right panel shows additional status of the ecmc motion axis

The different fields for the left side of the panel are explained in the below table.

The checkboxes are used to select a field for plotting (note: only one field can be selected currentlly).

To, for instance, plot the actula positon:

1. Check the checkbox on the same line as "actPos"

2. Press the "Plot" button

A new window will appear with a plot of the selected parameter:

![Plot GUI](doc/pics/ecmcTrend_small.png)

The plot window have a few controls:
Item | Field | Description
--- | --- | --- |
1 | Ymax group | Controls to set maximum y-axis value
2 | Ymax text input | Desired maximum y-axis value
3 | Ymax set button ">"  | Press to set re-zoom the plot based on Ymax text input
4 | Zoom auto  | Auto zoom of y axis
5 | Freeze  | Enable/disable update of plot
6 | Ymin group | Controls to set minimum y-axis value
7 | Ymin text input | Desired minimum y-axis value
8 | Ymin set button ">"  | Press to set re-zoom the plot based on Ymin text input
9 | Write PV group  | Controls to allow write to the selected process variable (greyed out if not allowd)
10 | Write PV text input  | Enter value to write to the selected process variable
11 | Write PV button ">"  | Issue write command to selected PV
12 | Buffer size | Set buffer size of plot (number of values to show)

In addition to these buttons there are also some functionalites for zooming and storing plots in the top part of the plot window. For additional information on these buttons plese checkout matplotlib.

## Start motion commands:

### Stop motion:
The motor can be stopped by pressing the "STOP" button (or in worst case CNEN button (not good for electronics) or E-Stop button).

### Start a positioning command:

1. Ensure that it is safe for the motor to be powered and move. Always have the E-stop within reach.
2. Ensure that there are no error code. If error, try to reset by the "Reset Error"
3. Ensure that the VELO field contains a resonable velocity.
4. Enable the amplifier by pushing the CNEN button. The CNEN button should turn green and the status "enabled" should show "1". can take a few seconds.
5. Enter a new target position in the "VAL" field. The motor should start rotating twoards the new target position.
6. The motor can be stopped by pressing the "STOP" button (or in worst case CNEN button (not good for electronics) or E-Stop button).

### Start a relative positioning command:

1. Ensure that it is safe for the motor to be powered and move. Always have the E-stop within reach.
2. Ensure that there are no error code. If error, try to reset by the "Reset Error"
3. Ensure that the VELO field contains a resonable velocity.
4. Enable the amplifier by pushing the CNEN button. The CNEN button should turn green and the status "enabled" should show "1". can take a few seconds.
5. Enter a the desired relative position in the TWEAK distance field.
6. Press the tweek forward button (">>") to move forward or the tweak backward button ("<<")to move backward the selected distance.
6. The motor can be stopped by pressing the "STOP" button (or in worst case CNEN button (not good for electronics) or E-Stop button).

### Start a jog (constant velocity) command:

1. Ensure that it is safe for the motor to be powered and move. Always have the E-stop within reach.
2. Ensure that there are no error code. If error, try to reset by the "Reset Error"
3. Ensure that the JVEL field contains a resonable velocity.
4. Enable the amplifier by pushing the CNEN button. The CNEN button should turn green and the status "enabled" should show "1". can take a few seconds.
5. Press the "JOGF" button for forward motion or the "JOGR" button for backward motion.
6. The motor can be stopped by pressing the "STOP" button (or in worst case CNEN button (not good for electronics) or E-Stop button).
